# My Journey
I was born and raised in London, but spent my formative years living in Lahore and Dubai. Moving around every from a young age and living in such distinct cities around the world has had a profound impact on my personality and approach. It has made me more resilient and comfortable in the face of challenges and change.

I completed my undergraduate education in Economics at King's College London, and studying a few modules in finance ignited my interest in the subject. Writing a debt and equity report of Barclays during one of the modules in my Third Year was an experience that I particularly enjoyed as I got the opportunity to use softwares like the Bloomberg Terminal and Microsoft Excel to apply topics I had learned in finance.

I then decided to pursue a Masters in Financial Analysis at LBS because of its practical and rigorous nature. Moreover, LBS's global environment will provide the ideal pathway to not just develop as a student of finance but as a human being as well.


# My Passion
I am primarily passionate about sports and nature in my life and I devote my free time to it. Sports has been an important aspect of my life from a young age. Swimming and doing gymnastics during my school days to playing cricket, football and squash during my undergraduate studies have played a critical role in my mental well-being and physical fitness as well as honing my leadership and communication skills. I am currently a member and treasurer of the Badminton Club at London Business School.

Secondly, watching National Geographic and History Channel from a young age evolved my interest in nature and history. To do this day I thoroughly enjoy watching documentaries like the Planet Earth and shows like the Cosmos to deepen my appreciation of nature. Furthermore, gardening and keeping pets enabled me to develop first hand appreciation and understanding of its importance in the our ecosystem.
