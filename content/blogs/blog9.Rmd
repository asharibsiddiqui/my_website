# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

We explore whether the true mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. As we can see according to the following graph, the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors overlap. 

*Sample Graph:*
```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

**Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?**

* Null Hypothesis: The true difference of mean IMDB ratings is equal to zero
* Alternative Hypothesis: The true difference of mean IMDB ratings is not equal to zero

We load the data and examine its structure.

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

We then recreate the plot above, using theme_wsj (we use this theme throughout this assignment).

```{r, intervals_graph}
#PREPPING DATA FOR PLOT
movies1 <- movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            count= n()) %>%
  mutate(se = sd / sqrt(count),
         lower_ci = mean - qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), count - 1) * se,
         upper_ci = mean + qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), count - 1) * se)

#PREPPING DATA FOR LATER ANALYSIS
movies_dir <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

       ) +

                 size = 3)
             ) +
  
  #add grey rectangles for overlap
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=max(lower_ci), 
                xmax=min(upper_ci), 
                ymin = -Inf, 
                ymax = +Inf,

                    color = director, 
                    size = 1.5)
                )+
  
  #labels
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same IMDB ratings?", 
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap", 
       y = "", 
       x = "Mean IMDB Rating"
       )+

              hjust=0.4, 
              vjust=-0.4, 
              fill = NA, 
              label.size = NA
              )+

              hjust=0.4, 
              vjust=-0.4,

              )+
  
  #remove legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  
  #add mean as text
  geom_text(aes(label=round(mean,2), 
                vjust =-2)
            ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12), #denotes x-axis ticks
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), #denotes y-axis ticks
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12)
  ) 

```

Finally, we perform a hypothesis test, using two methods. First, using the t-test, and second by simulating data with the infer package.

```{r, IMDB_hypothesis_test}

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(rating~director, data=movies_dir)

# initialise the test
movies_obs_diff <- movies_dir %>% 
  specify(rating ~ director) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton"))

# hypothesis testing using infer package (details in lec slide58, 61, also the question1)
# simulate the null hypothesis
movies_null_diff <- movies_dir %>% 
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  hypothesise(null="independence") %>% #hypothesis of no difference
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) 

# visualise the distribution and check the p-value
movies_null_diff %>%
  visualise()+
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = movies_obs_diff, direction = "two-sided") +
  theme_wsj(base_size = 9) +
    labs(title = "Null Distribution", 
       subtitle = "Spielberg and Burton Have the Same Mean IMDB Rating", 
       y = "Count", 
       x = ""
       )

# calculate the p-value
movies_null_diff %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = movies_obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

```

Given that our 95% Confidence Intervals overlap (as seen in the graph), would like to understand whether the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton could be identical or not. Therefore, we begin with the null hypothesis: there is no difference between each director's mean IMDB rating. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between their mean IMDB ratings

We use two methods to investigate this null hypothesis.

First, we use the t-test function. From this, we obtain a t-statistic of 2.7144 and a p-value of 0.01078. Given that we obtain a t-stat greater than 2, and a p-value smaller than 5% (which are the usual benchmarks for this kind of analysis i.e. we're not doing physics here), we can reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is a significant difference between the mean IMDB ratings of each director, which we cannot ignore. 

Second, we use the infer package to simulate data corresponding to the null hypothesis. We then calculate a p-value for our difference in mean rating, given the null distribution. We find that it typically lies between 0.8%-1.4%, which is below the 5% threshold. Thus, we again reject the null hypothesis.
